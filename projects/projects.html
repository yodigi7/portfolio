                    This project was inspired by the game Quiplash made by Jackbox Games.
                    It has a Java Spring backend to store all of the game data on the server.
                    The frontend consists of Angular/Vue to act as frontend where the data is either displayed or gathered from the user.
                    Currently the frontend makes polling calls to the backend for updates on things such as the game phase when waiting on another player to complete a task.
                    A way to optimize this would be to use either websockets to keep open for the duration of the game or to utilize server push which is new in HTTP 2.
                    This project was built to handle multiple concurrent games with the option to use your own LAN server if necessary.

                    When I was an avid Runescape player I enjoyed the idea of making gold off of "flipping" which was very similar to the way the stock market works.
                    This interest intersected with my love for AI, ML, and programming in general.
                    I decided to make a tool to make this easier with a custom GUI and a predictive AI in the background.
                    The first step was to create a web scraper sending rest requests to the Runescape API for item prices and store in the database for record keeping.
                    I then built a GUI using pyQt to display the database in a more user friendly way.
                    I then setup a few simple AI algorithms with sklearn to try to predict the future trend of the item but unsurprisingly did not do very well.

                    My father had always had trouble keeping his data together and organized in a nice format for his insurance company.
                    In response to this I offered to build a database for him however I would need help understanding what his needs were.
                    This was my first experience with a problem where I had to interface with a "customer" who had a problem but didn't speak my language so to speak.
                    This helped me to be able to try to simplify things such that we were able to efficiently communicate and get the necessary requirements.
                    This project was built with python as the backend to store the data in a mysql server.
                    The frontend was built with Vue which was my first experience with a javascript framework.
                    The frontend was purely for a CRUD UI for the database along with a few forms that would return a predefined complex query.
